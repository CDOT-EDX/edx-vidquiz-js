VidQuiz.js
==========

About
-----

This tiny JS application creates a video player that at pre-set times asks the user a question, and awaits an answer. The purpose of this application is to be used in edX as an IFrame component in a course unit.

The functionality is really basic, and it might include a grading feature soon that updates a student's profile on edX. 

Configuration is all manual and there is no editor included, but an XBlock might be created in the near future that has all of these functionalities.

This application was made for Seneca College, but you may use the code for your own purposes.

There will be no further updates, as I have focused on turning this module into an edX XBlock. See https://github.com/uw-ray/edx-vidquiz .

Setup
-----

1). Rename quiz.html and quiz.js to whatever names you wish
	- ensure that in quiz.html, line 12 matches quiz.js

2). Modify quiz.js to contain the quiz questions you wish
	- simply add new entries in the quiz_questions array
	- the pattern used is as follows:
	[trigger time, question, answer, number of tries (optional)]

3). Upload all files to an edX course and remember the static address of quiz.html
	- It is a wise idea to lock both quiz.html and quiz.js to prevent non-staff access

4). In your edX course, create a HTML->IFrame component in the unit you wish
	- set the IFrame source to the static address of quiz.html
	- you may want to adjust the width and height of the IFrame to fit the video being played
